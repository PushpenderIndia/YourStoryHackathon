## 🧭 Project Overview

India is vibrant, diverse, and deeply cultural — yet most tourists see only what's marketed, missing the voices of artisans, hidden traditions, and real stories behind monuments.

Why this gap?

- Planning culturally rich trips is confusing and time-consuming.
- Local art forms are dying due to lack of visibility.
- Visually impaired travelers are excluded from meaningful experiences.
- Travelers and locals rarely exchange cultural knowledge in real time.

So we built **Rang Yatra** — a cultural bridge powered by **AI, storytelling, data, and empathy.**
