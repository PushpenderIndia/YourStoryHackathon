## 🧭 Project Overview

India is diverse, colorful, and culturally deep — yet most people experience only a fraction of it. Why?

- It's hard to plan trips beyond popular destinations.
- Local art forms are dying without digital presence or funding.
- Visually impaired tourists are left out of monument experiences.
- There's no platform for travelers and locals to truly connect in real time.

**Malaai** (Mapping Art, Language, Accessibility, and AI) is designed to fix that.

We built a travel experience where **AI meets inclusivity**, where **communities guide you**, and where **data fuels cultural preservation**.
